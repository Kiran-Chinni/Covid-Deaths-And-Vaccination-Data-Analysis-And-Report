# Covid-Deaths-And-Vaccination-Data-Analysis-And-Report


With this downloaded data set from website related to covid deaths (Excel format). I have first cleaned and analysed the data using SQL server and then created the Power BI report for the same. So I have divided these two activities as 2 separate project.


**Covid Deaths And Vaccination Data Analysis:**

Here I tried to analysis the data for 
1. total_cases vs total_deaths 
2. total_cases vs population (country wise)
3. countries with highest infection rates 
4. Global death percentage
5. Total population vs vaccinations 
6. Percentage of population vaccinated 
and so on using SQL queries in Microsoft SQL server management studio.



**Responsibilities:**

•	Data base was created in SQL server and the excel format data sets were imported to database as tables.

•	Identified what the fields to analysis like total_cases vs total_deaths, total_cases vs population (country wise), countries with highest infection rates, Global death   percentage, Total population vs vaccinations.

•	Used various SQL queries like Joins, Views, CTE, Temp Tables, Over & Partition By etc.

•	Using SQL queries, I was able to get all the answers to the analysis questions.
